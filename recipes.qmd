This is my recipe for **tomatosoup** passed down for generations. The **tomatosoup** is quite tasty.

# Ingredients

-   Butter -- use unsalted butter to sautee onions

-   Yellow onion -- it seems like a ton of onion but it dissapears into the soup adding a balanced sweetness

-   Garlic -- you'll need 1 Tbsp minced from about 3 cloves

-   Crushed tomatoes -- with their juice, preferably

-   San Marzano tomatoes Chicken stock -- for the best flavor use homemade chicken broth Basil -- chop and add

-   1/4 cup fresh basil, plus more to serve. Basil leaves are easily bruised so chop by stacking a bunch of leaves then roll them into a log and cut into thin strips.

-   Sugar -- It's just 1 Tbsp, but necessary to combat the tomato acidity.

-   Black pepper -- start with 1/2 tsp and add more to taste

-   Whipping cream -- adds a creaminess to the soup and offsets acidity.

-   Parmesan cheese -- adds saltiness to the soup and balances acidity. Adding parmesan adds enough salt and I usually don't add more.

## **Actual Cooking**

-   *Saute Aromatics* -- heat a non-reactive pot over medium heat. Melt in 4 Tbsp butter then sautee onions until softened and golden (10-12 min). Add minced garlic and saute another minute.

-   *Make the tomato soup base* -- stir in two 28 oz cans of crushed tomatoes with their juice, your chicken stock, chopped basil, sugar and black pepper. Bring to a boil then reduce heat, partially cover and simmer 10 minutes.

-   *Blend if desired* -- use an immersion blender in the pot or blend in batches using a blender (be careful not to overfill the blender with hot liquid) and return soup to the pot.

-   *Add cream and parmesan* -- stir in the heavy cream and shredded parmesan. Return to a simmer and season to taste if needed. Serve -- ladle into warm bowls and garnish with more parmesan and basil.
